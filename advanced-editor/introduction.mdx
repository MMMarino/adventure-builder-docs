# Welcome to Adventure Builder Advanced Editor

The Advanced Editor is a powerful extension to Adventure Builder that allows builders to build more sophisticated and interactive levels.

The Roblox Studio plugin integrates directly with Adventure Builder, allowing you to build levels in Studio and save them directly to your Adventure Builder profile.

With the Interactions feature, you can add custom Lua code to make your levels more dynamic and engaging.
