To retrieve more information about a user using the `userId`, we can utilize the Roblox API.

## Using the Roblox API

Roblox provides several endpoints that allow us to query details about a user given their `userId`. Below are examples of how to use these APIs.

### Example: Getting Username from userId

You can use the following Roblox API endpoint to get the username of a user from their `userId`:

#### Endpoint:
`https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/{userId}`

#### Example Request:

```bash
GET https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/123456789
openapi: 'GET /level/{level_id}'
