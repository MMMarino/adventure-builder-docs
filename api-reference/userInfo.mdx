# Retrieving User Information from `userId`

In some of our API responses, you will encounter a `userId` field. This `userId` is an identifier for a user, but additional information such as their username, profile picture, and other details are not included directly.

To retrieve more information about a user using the `userId`, we can utilize the Roblox API.

## Using the Roblox API

Roblox provides several endpoints that allow us to query details about a user given their `userId`. Below are examples of how to use these APIs.

### Example: Getting Username from userId

You can use the following Roblox API endpoint to get the username of a user from their `userId`:

#### Endpoint:
`https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/{userId}`

#### Example Request:

```bash
GET https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/123456789
openapi: 'GET /level/{level_id}'
