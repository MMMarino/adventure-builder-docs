Instead of telling users to join a specific level by its ID, you can create a sleek redirect button!

## Externally

Use the following URL format to redirect users directly to a level:

```
https://invite.adventure-builder.net/{level_id}
```

When users click this link, Roblox will launch and prompt them to play the specified level.

## On Roblox
<Note>Make sure to enable **"Allow Third-Party Teleports"** in *Game Settings* -> *Security*.</Note>

If you want to redirect users from within your Roblox game, you can achieve this using [TeleportService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TeleportService). Here's how you can set up the teleportation with level data:

```lua redirect.lua (Server)
local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
local game = 15498261012 -- Adventure Builder

local player = game.Players:GetPlayers()[1] -- Get a player
local target = 0 -- Replace with the level ID you wanna teleport to.

-- Set the teleport data
local teleportData = Instance.new("TeleportOptions")
teleportData:SetTeleportData({level_id = target})

-- Teleport the player
TeleportService:Teleport(game, player, teleportData)
```
<Note>**TeleportService:Teleport()** can only be invoked on the server.</Note>

And voil√†! You've now implemented a stylish way to redirect players to a specific level.
